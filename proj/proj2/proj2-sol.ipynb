For example, in the case of cancer screenings, false negatives are comparatively worse than false positives — a false negative means that a patient might not discover a disease until it's too late to treat, while a false positive means that a patient will probably have to take another screening.\n",

Then, to classify an example we say that an email is spam if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.5$ probability of being spam. However, *we can adjust that cutoff*: we can say that an email is spam only if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.7$ probability of being spam, for example. This is how we can trade off false positives and false negatives.\n",
