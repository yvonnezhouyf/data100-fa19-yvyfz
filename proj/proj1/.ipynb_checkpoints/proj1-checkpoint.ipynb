The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The main goal for this assignment is to understand how restaurants are scored.

    "3. By grouping with business id, I would find all the records about a certain business in a specific location. By grouping with the name, I would find all the records about a certian business, but the result might contain businesses with the same name but in mutiple locations. This is especialy for chain stores like Starbucks Coffee. When grouping with business id, I would only get records of a specific Starbucks like the Starbucks on 1800 IRVING ST. But if I group with name, I would get the records of all the Starbucks in the data frame. By grouping with address, I would get records of the stores in the same location. This demands all records has specific locations, and stores needs to be as specific as possible, like stores on the same floor should also have different addresses."

    "1. `count null`: The number of missing values for the zip code.\n",

There are no unusual features of this distribution, and my observations about the scores implies that the scores are tend to be high in the 90-100 range, which means that most of the restaurants are in good condition and receives good scores in inspections."

If a `business_id` in `ins` does not exist in `bus`, the name and address should be given as NaN.\n",

    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",
